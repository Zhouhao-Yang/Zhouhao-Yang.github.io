 In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of biases in RS-PINN, attributing them to the nonlinearity of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss as well 
 as the intrinsic
 nonlinearity of the PDE itself. We also propose tailored bias correction techniques, delineating their application based
 on the order of PDE nonlinearity. The derivation of an unbiased RS-PINN allows for a detailed examination of its
 advantages and disadvantages compared to the biased version.
