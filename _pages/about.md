I am now a PhD student from the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the Johns Hopkins University. My research interests span continuous-time Reinforcement Learning, AI for Science, and memory-efficient LLMs.

From August 2023 to July 2024, I was a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at National University of Singapore. I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/) and Professor [Kenji Kawaguchi](https://ml.comp.nus.edu.sg/).
