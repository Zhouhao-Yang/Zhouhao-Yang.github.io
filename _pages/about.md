I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at National University of Singapore. My research interests span AI for Science, high-dimensional statistics, optimization for ML, reinforcement learning, and information theory.

I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/). Previously, I was supervised by Professor [Kenji Kawaguchi](https://ml.comp.nus.edu.sg/).
