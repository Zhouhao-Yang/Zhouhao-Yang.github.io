Hi! Welcome to my personal website!

I am now a PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the Johns Hopkins University. My research interests span AI for Science, high-dimensional statistics, optimization for ML, generative models, bandits, and information theory.

From July 2023 to July 2024, I was a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at National University of Singapore. I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/) and Professor [Kenji Kawaguchi](https://ml.comp.nus.edu.sg/).
