I am currently a PhD student in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) at Johns Hopkins University. My research interests include continuous-time reinforcement learning, AI for science, and memory-efficient finetuning for large language models.

From August 2023 to July 2024, I was a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore, where I had the privilege of being advised by [Professor Jonathan Scarlett](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~scarlett/) and [Professor Kenji Kawaguchi](https://ml.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics from [Zhiyuan College](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
