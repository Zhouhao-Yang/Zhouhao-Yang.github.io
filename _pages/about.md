I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University. My research interests include continuous-time reinforcement learning, AI for science, and memory-efficient large language models.

From August 2023 to July 2024, I was a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore, where I had the privilege of being advised by Professor Jonathan Scarlett and Professor Kenji Kawaguchi.

I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics from Zhiyuan College, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
